    Serverless was and is a great option for developers whose load varies and
    providers who don't want to keep resources idle for processes that reserved
    them and might need them soon. However, the reality of serverless today does
    not match up in many different ways; most notably it has a variance in
    latencies that jobs experience that is not tolerable for latency sensitive
    workloads. The common approach to this is to work on cold starts. 

    This paper asks what comes next; once cold starts in the single digit ms
    range, which we are starting to see in research schedulers, are commercially
    available, have we figured out a system that can run serverless in its ideal
    form?

    We show that this is not the case, and that once more latency senstive jobs
    are able to run alongside the usual map reduce and image resize jobs, we
    will need some way of prioritising which jobs are important in order to keep
    their overall latencies acceptable.
    
    We propose a new scheduler, \sys{}, that introduces \emph{\priceclass{}es}.
    Developers assign each job they want to run to a \priceclass{}, which is a
    priority that \sys{} then enforces at invocation, both in placing the job
    and on the machine level by running priority scheduling. We show that \sys{}
    is able to enforce priorities and keep high \class{} jobs latencies stable
    even under high load.
