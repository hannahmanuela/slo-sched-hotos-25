Serverless was and is a great option for developers whose load varies and
providers who don't want to keep resources idle for processes that reserved
them. However, the reality of serverless today is that functions experience a
variance in latencies that is not tolerable for latency sensitive workloads. 

The common approach to this is to work on cold starts. This paper asks what
comes next; once cold starts in the single digit ms range (which we are starting
to see in research schedulers) are commercially available, have we figured out a
system that can run serverless in its ideal form?

We show that this is not the case, and that once more latency senstive functions
are able to run alongside the usual map reduce and image resize functions, we
will need some way of prioritising which functions are latency sensitive in
order to keep their latencies acceptable.

We propose a new scheduler, \sys{}, that introduces \emph{\priceclass{}es}.
Developers assign each function they want to run to a \priceclass{}, which
encodes a priority that \sys{} then enforces at invocation, both in placing the
function and on the machine level by running priority scheduling. We show that
\sys{} is able to enforce priorities and keep high \class{} functions latencies
stable even under high load.
