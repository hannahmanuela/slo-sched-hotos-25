Serverless was and is a great option for developers whose load varies and
providers who don't want to keep resources idle for processes that reserved
them. However, the reality of serverless today is that functions experience a
variance in latencies that is not tolerable for latency sensitive workloads. 

We propose a new scheduler, \sys{}, that introduces \emph{\priceclass{}es}.
Developers assign each function they want to run to a \priceclass{}, which
encodes a priority that \sys{} then enforces at invocation, both in placing the
function and on the machine level by running priority scheduling. We show that
\sys{} is able to enforce priorities and keep high \class{} functions latencies
stable even under high load.
