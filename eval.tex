\section{Implementation And Preliminary Results}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To understand the dynamics of the single machine scheduler, we implement a
prototype that uses linux’ SCHED-FIFO to enforce priorities.\hmng{ also talk about
options that we thought about in terms of EEVDF/EDF, nice values, etc? Might
come out of nowhere given that this wasn’t a huge deal in the design, but on the
other hand it is what I’ve spent the most time on }

< graph 1: representative microbench comparing straight CFS linux vs cgroups vs nice values vs priority >

To model the whole systems’ dynamics, we built a simulator. \hmng{List assumptions and variables?}

< graph 2: graph of latency (and matching graph of utilization?) as load increases; per priority >
