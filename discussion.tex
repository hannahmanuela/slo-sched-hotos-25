--- talk about max proportions of each priority and how it relates to how lower
priority have latency degradation vs just never running


--- talk about memory/killing and overprovisioning; if we want good memory
utilization we should overprovision, and be prepared to kill something. Ideally
have a pay-per-usage model, but then have a problem of right-sliding. Do
profiling? But that will affect our decision of whether to place or not, whether
we end up needing to kill or not. Maybe have conditional placements or
something?
