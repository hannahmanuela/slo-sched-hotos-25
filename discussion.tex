We have seen that having priorities helps \sys{} deal with overprovisioning for
compute. Traditionally, managing the response time for important jobs requires
the overall load on the system to be low, because slowdown is averaged across
all the jobs that can share resources. However, having priorities allows \sys{}
to be targeted about how compute resources are shared: rather than averaging out
the slowdown caused by overprovisioning across all the jobs by having them time
share the cores, \sys{} can use priorities to decide which job has to wait. This
means that in priority scheduling the amount of time a job spends waiting for
resources is only defined by the load of jobs with equal or higher priority.

The flipside of this is that it is possible that the entire load of the
datacenter will be such that low priority jobs are starved. This is acceptable
and in fact desirable for small amounts of time, but keeping this effect in
check requires managing the overall load. 

We propose to solve this problem by ensuring that it can never be the case the
there is so much load on high priority jobs that the data center will be full
with them to such a degree that other jobs can't run. There is evidence for and
we expect that load on a high level will mostly be stable, with diurnal and
annual patterns.\cite{TODO}

This means that providers can mostly choose the rough breakdown of the load they
will have at any given time (ie they can choose a percentage of how many jobs
they want in each priority, and change it by adjusting prices or not allowing
users to select that level anymore).
